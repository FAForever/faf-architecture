# Use Slack as central developer chat 

* Status: superseded
* Deciders: Visionik, Sheeo
* Date: 02.11.2014

## Context and Problem Statement

FAForever was open sourced as a community project.

A tool for developer community has to be selected.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Funding was available for any choice
* Smartphones are a thing to consider

## Considered Options

* IRC
* Slack

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Slack", as it was the innovative disruptor that offered more capabilities than IRC.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Cloud hosted, so no additional maintenance overhead
* "Gated community": Invite only for interested people.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Running costs or (later in free model) restricted history
